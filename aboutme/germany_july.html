                <h3>July 08, 00:57</h3>
                <h4>Lengfeld</h4>
                <p>I failed to mention in the past couple of entries that I received Pat's mother's bike! I've been putting it to good use, taking it to work about every other day. Last Wednesday I took it to a vineyard on a hill that overlooked a little festival, and in the distance all of W端rzburg. After a bottle of wine at the vineyard, a couple of friends and I went to the club where I should not have had any more drinks but did. I have been told that you can get a DUI for riding your bike drunk; so let's just let that be the reason why I wasn't able to make it home and had to spend the night at Logan's place.</p>
                <p>Friday after lunch, we said farewell to Tristan, who was going to France with his mom for the weekend. That night I had dinner with the two of them because there was an issue with their flights and they decided to just spend their time in W端rzburg. So it was good! We got to party with Tristan's mom a little bit and she bought us breakfast and lunch the next day so that we could start our Canada Day with full stomachs. We were going to need them...</p>
                <p>Our plan for Canada's 150<sup>th</sup> birthday was to collectively drink and share 150 drinks throughout the course of the night. We were drinking beer, gin, vodka, rum, and even Baileys from 16:00 or so until things started getting a little out of control. One of my Canadian friends celebrated a little too hard and by the end of the night was incapable of stringing together simple sentences. Actually, not even simple words! But let's take a step back to just after what we think was our 125<sup>th</sup> shot. I offered to take my buddy to his flat, and doing so proved to be a <em>huge</em> challenge. Luckily, my buddy and I came across these two girls, Melanie and Chiara. They were at first looking to party with us, but were convinced by my intoxicated friend that it'd be a good idea to come along and hang out with us at his flat. I don't know exactly where he lives, and at this point, neither does he. So we walked a lot longer than I expected. Along the way he ends up taking off his shirt, running and face-planting at least twice, lying on the side of the road stopping good Samaritans, and trying to mumble German sentences while refusing to speak comprehensible English. Thanks to the girls and a really really good Samaritan, an ambulance came and quite necessarily took my friend to the hospital. I got home at around 6:00, then shortly after I visited him in the hospital. He didn't remember a thing. He ended up alright and we had some good laughs!</p>
                <p>One of the girls who we went to the club with on Wednesday invited me and Tristan to go to spend the next Monday night at her place in a small village of about 50 people. There was a wine festival, where there were older and younger people dancing, singing, and having a really good time. That night stayed under control and hence felt very brief.</p>
                <p>Now you might begin to see why I had no time last week to update my blog. The next morning we drive back to W端rzburg just in time for work. Without going home after work, in the same clothes I put on the previous morning, Logan and I met up with Chiara and Melanie, the girls from Canada Day. We had a really nice evening chilling by the river. Before we knew it, it was a quarter after midnight, and all of the busses to Lengfeld had stopped running. Logan once again kindly offered me a place to sleep that night. The next morning it was back to work in the same clothes from two days prior.</p>
                <p>Once I was able to get home and shower, it was time to go out again with my bike to the vineyard on the hill, go to a house party, jump in the river, and go to work the next day. This lifestyle is far from sustainable. With that being said, I am quite grateful that I have been able to rest for the past couple of days. <em>Today</em>, I'll be going to W端rzburg's scaled down version of Munich's Oktoberfest. And the cycle continues...</p>
