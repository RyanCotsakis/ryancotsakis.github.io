                <h3>July 08, 00:57</h3>
                <h4>Lengfeld</h4>
                <p>I failed to mention in the past couple of entries that I received Pat's mother's bike! I've been putting it to good use, taking it to work about every other day. Last Wednesday I took it to a vineyard on a hill that overlooked a little festival, and in the distance all of Würzburg. After a bottle of wine at the vineyard, a couple of friends and I went to the club where I should not have had any more drinks but did. I have been told that you can get a DUI for riding your bike drunk; so let's just let that be the reason why I wasn't able to make it home and had to spend the night at Logan's place.</p>
                <p>Friday after lunch, we said farewell to Tristan, who was going to France with his mom for the weekend. That night I had dinner with the two of them because there was an issue with their flights and they decided to just spend their time in Würzburg. So it was good! We got to party with Tristan's mom a little bit and she bought us breakfast and lunch the next day so that we could start our Canada Day with full stomachs. We were going to need them...</p>
                <p>Our plan for Canada's 150<sup>th</sup> birthday was to collectively drink and share 150 drinks throughout the course of the night. We were drinking beer, gin, vodka, rum, and even Baileys from 16:00 or so until things started getting a little out of control. One of my Canadian friends celebrated a little too hard and by the end of the night was incapable of stringing together simple sentences. Actually, not even simple words! But let's take a step back to just after what we think was our 125<sup>th</sup> shot. I offered to take my buddy to his flat, and doing so proved to be a <em>huge</em> challenge. Luckily, my buddy and I came across these two girls, Melanie and Chiara. They were at first looking to party with us, but were convinced by my intoxicated friend that it'd be a good idea to come along and hang out with us at his flat. I don't know exactly where he lives, and at this point, neither does he. So we walked a lot longer than I expected. Along the way he ends up taking off his shirt, running and face-planting at least twice, lying on the side of the road stopping good Samaritans, and trying to mumble German sentences while refusing to speak comprehensible English. Thanks to the girls and a really really good Samaritan, an ambulance came and quite necessarily took my friend to the hospital. I got home at around 6:00, then shortly after I visited him in the hospital. He didn't remember a thing. He ended up alright and we had some good laughs!</p>
                <p>One of the girls who we went to the club with on Wednesday invited me and Tristan to go to spend the next Monday night at her place in a small village of about 50 people. There was a wine festival, where there were older and younger people dancing, singing, and having a really good time. That night stayed under control and hence felt very brief.</p>
                <p>Now you might begin to see why I had no time last week to update my blog. The next morning we drive back to Würzburg just in time for work. Without going home after work, in the same clothes I put on the previous morning, Logan and I met up with Chiara and Melanie, the girls from Canada Day. We had a really nice evening chilling by the river. Before we knew it, it was a quarter after midnight, and all of the busses to Lengfeld had stopped running. Logan once again kindly offered me a place to sleep that night. The next morning it was back to work in the same clothes from two days prior.</p>
                <p>Once I was able to get home and shower, it was time to go out again with my bike to the vineyard on the hill, go to a house party, jump in the river, and go to work the next day. This lifestyle is far from sustainable. With that being said, I am quite grateful that I have been able to rest for the past couple of days. <em>Today</em>, I'll be going to Würzburg's scaled down version of Munich's Oktoberfest. And the cycle continues...</p>

                <h4>University of Würzburg</h4>
                <p>There are a few things I should get out of the way before I dive into the multitude of events that have happened in the last week. First of all, I haven’t seen Oana since maybe a week or two before Laika left. She has been living in Augsburg while continuing to pay rent to our flat. Secondly, for about two weeks now, my Samsung S7 thinks that there is moisture in the charging port and so it doesn’t want to let me charge it. Luckily, every once in awhile it works for a bit, but lately it has stubbornly refused any recharging. Right now it’s soaking in some white rice, which will hopefully lift the issue.</p>
                <p>Allow me to give a very brief outline of my past few days. Not last Saturday but the one before, I went to Kiliani (the festival I wrote about in the previous entry) with Logan, Rory, Melanie, and some of her friends. There were a lot of lederhosens, and a lot of beer served in one litre mugs. It was the epitome of a German celebration. The next day I saw Cedrick and Joni for the first time in a long time. We went to Erlabrunn and afterwards played Friends of Gas. Since we love overplaying that game, the next day I invited some of my Canadian friends over to my flat for the first time and I introduced it to them. A couple of days later I went to Tristan’s flat after work for a party with his neighbours; the day after that, my friend Theresa cooked one of the best dishes of vegetables I’ve ever had; and on that same night, my friends and I went out dancing at a nightclub. But wait there’s more…</p>
                <p>I took last Friday off work to go to Köln (Cologne), Germany. Tristan’s mom’s friend Svenja had space for him and one friend to stay Friday and Saturday night. I am thrilled that Tristan invited me to go with him because it was maybe the most eventful and pleasant weekend I’ve had this summer. When we arrived in the evening, we met Svenja and her son Nico at a café in town. I was overwhelmed by how hospitable they were. On the way to their beautiful home (which was flying a Canadian flag for us), they bought us three packs of Köln’s infamous beer called Kölsch, and ordered us a pizza for dinner. Svenja was going out that night so she left Tristan and I in the hands of Nico, who we partied with all night. Nico had just turned 16, the legal drinking age in Germany, so it was our pleasure to take him out on his first night at a bar. He was <em>the</em> life of the party. At the bar, he introduced himself and us to the girls at the next table. So we merged the tables and partied with them for the rest of the night. The best thing about that night was Nico’s unmistakable gratitude for the time we showed him.</p>
                <p>The next morning, after we were treated to a beautiful homemade breakfast, Tristan and I met up with Kathi, a girl we met in Konstanz, and her friends. The six of us took a boat ride up and back down the Rhine and then went to another café in town. Our group slowly dwindled back down to just me and Tristan, and we hurried on back to Svenja’s house because she and her husband Markus were preparing a barbeque for us. It was nothing short of amazing. Markus and Svenja had a party to go to that night, so it was once again going to be the three amigos. We were lucky enough to be in Köln for what they jokingly called “Köln’s fourth of July”. So, that night we biked down the river and witnessed an awesome display of fireworks. Nico met up with a buddy of his, so at about midnight Tristan and I decide to bike to a place where we could go dancing. The first club we visited wouldn’t let us in because we were reasonably underdressed. We got in the second club, which was strangely decorated and had exclusively German music. We started getting into it, and into some beers, then discovered there was a downstairs that was playing stuff from artists like Michael Jackson and the Backstreet Boys. There, we met these two girls who had travelled from Bonn to Köln for the night. Tristan and would take turns going to the bar, getting four Kölsch, and drinking two each. We did this until about 4:00 when we went with the girls from Bonn to Burger King, where we messed up our order and met a couple losers who were making fun of the girls for whatever reason. So we left Burger King, and discovered that the bar had closed, making their jackets (and my toque) irretrievable. The fun was over, but the Kölsch was not. We got one more litre of Kölsch at a convenience store, said goodbye to the girls, and biked home. It was about 7:00 when we arrived home, and 10:00 when we got up for another breakfast and played ping pong with Nico and Markus. We said goodbye to the Baum family, and made our way back to Würzburg.</p>
                <p>Life back home has been pretty usual. Again, I went to Kiliani, and the next day saw Cedrick and Joni. I could write about the barbeque party we organized but that would make this block of text even more daunting. So I will conclude the story here, and head home from my office now.</p>
