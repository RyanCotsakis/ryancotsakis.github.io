                <h4>Over the Atlantic</h4>
                <p>Well, I'm on my way to Frankfurt... I actually cannot believe my circumstances right now. I don't have any really interesting updates, but I've got nothing to do, and I have some time to write. One thing I do not have is my laptop charger. In the big hurry to get out the door this morning, I forgot that one at home. Last night I had a bunch of friends over, so it was not until this morning that I got my stuff together. Thanks for coming guys! And thanks for cleaning up Mom!</p>
                <p>Something kind of interesting... By the time I had landed in Toronto, my plane to Frankfurt had begun boarding ten minutes prior. It's a good thing I'm not lugging around any slow-pokes with me because I had to jog across the entire Toronto airport. I just hope that the luggage guy was in as much of a hurry as I was.</p>
                <p>I just finished watching the movie "Lion". Excellent movie! If you haven't seen it, do so. It's a true story about a boy who gets lost from his family in India. By the end of the movie I was a sobbing mess, which was very difficult to conceal when you have 50 strangers in a 6' radius. I am going to miss my family, my friends, and Kate all so much. But I am comforted by the fact that they and I are going to have a lot of fun this Summer!</p>

                <h4>Babelfish Hostel</h4>
                <p>These last two days have lasted for what feels like ten. I have slept two nights in this hostel, and tonight should be my last. I have finally found a place to stay. I'll be living with two very kind students a few kilometers away from the University. It's on the 5th floor of an apartment that calls the ground floor "0", and the view is impeccable. The only kicker is that I'll need to buy a mattress for the bed frame that they have for me; but on the bright side, at least it'll be new!</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time searching for this place. My supervisor at the university was pretty concerned that I hadn't found a place to stay, so he kindly let my housing search consume most of my day at work. Now that I have less to worry about, I am looking forward to actually immersing myself in the experiment. I am working alongside a couple of graduate students that are investigating the crystallographic structure of Magnesium Oxide bonded on the surface of Ir(100). As of now I know very little about the physics pertaining to this experiment, and my job right now is just to change that. The students im working for are always teaching me new things. For instance, we spent a few hours on the first day going over the operation of the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). After spending a while loading the sample, we were able to use the STM to image the individual atoms on the surface of the iridium. Really cool stuff!</p>
                <p>I'm spending money pretty quickly. I have so far purchased food, a laptop charger, train and bus tickets, and 4 nights at the hostel. I've already gone through 200â‚¬. I'll (hopefully) be getting a German bank account tomorrow morning, which now that I think of it, can only accelerate my spending...</p>
