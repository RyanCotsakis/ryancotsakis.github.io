                <h4>Over the Atlantic</h4>
                <p>Well, I'm on my way to Frankfurt... I actually cannot believe my circumstances right now. I don't have any really interesting updates, but I've got nothing to do, and I have some time to write. One thing I do not have is my laptop charger. In the big hurry to get out the door this morning, I forgot that one at home. Last night I had a bunch of friends over, so it was not until this morning that I got my stuff together. Thanks for coming guys! And thanks for cleaning up Mom!</p>
                <p>Something kind of interesting... By the time I had landed in Toronto, my plane to Frankfurt had begun boarding ten minutes prior. It's a good thing I'm not lugging around any slow-pokes with me because I had to jog across the entire Toronto airport. I just hope that the luggage guy was in as much of a hurry as I was.</p>
                <p>I just finished watching the movie "Lion". Excellent movie! If you haven't seen it, do so. It's a true story about a boy who gets lost from his family in India. By the end of the movie I was a sobbing mess, which was very difficult to conceal when you have 50 strangers in a 6' radius. I am going to miss my family, my friends, and Kate all so much. But I am comforted by the fact that they and I are going to have a lot of fun this Summer!</p>

                <h4>Babelfish Hostel</h4>
                <p>These last two days have lasted for what feels like ten. I have slept two nights in this hostel, and tonight should be my last. I have finally found a place to stay. I'll be living with two very kind students a few kilometers away from the University. It's on the 5th floor of an apartment that calls the ground floor "0", and the view is impeccable. The only kicker is that I'll need to buy a mattress for the bed frame that they have for me; but on the bright side, at least it'll be new!</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time searching for this place. My supervisor at the university was pretty concerned that I hadn't found a place to stay, so he kindly let my housing search consume most of my day at work. Now that I have less to worry about, I am looking forward to actually immersing myself in the experiment. I am working alongside a couple of graduate students that are investigating the crystallographic structure of Magnesium Oxide bonded on the surface of Ir(100). As of now I know very little about the physics pertaining to this experiment, and my job right now is just to change that. The students im working for are always teaching me new things. For instance, we spent a few hours on the first day going over the operation of the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). After spending a while loading the sample, we were able to use the STM to image the individual atoms on the surface of the iridium. Really cool stuff!</p>
                <p>I'm spending money pretty quickly. I have so far purchased food, a laptop charger, train and bus tickets, and 4 nights at the hostel. I've already gone through 200€. I'll (hopefully) be getting a German bank account tomorrow morning, which now that I think of it, can only accelerate my spending...</p>

                <p>Well, pretty much everything has been sorted out. I have a bank account, a place to live, a mattress, my student card, and as of today, my own desktop computer at work. Germany is starting to feel like my home away from home.</p>
                <p>There are many differences between Würzburg and Vancouver, which happen to generate much of my conversations with the locals who speak English. For example, the bus drivers here are tasked with navigating through windy side streets which are at many times wide enough for one car. The automated voices that announce the next stop are of children, and at the end of the ride no one thanks the driver. Come to think of it, it took me by surprise when I first heard someone shout "Thank you!" from the back of the bus.</p>
                <p>I haven't mentioned this anywhere on this website, but I came to Würzburg with 4 of my friends from Engineering Physics. The other I met up with three of them, and they introduced me to a couple of other guys who study at UBC. The 6 of us walked up to this castle from the 16th century, went through a museum, and had a couple of beers. After that, I ended up at a house party where I learned that it is commonplace to bring beer or wine and share with everybody. It made for a very fun party!</p>
                <p>A couple of times I have found myself in the small elevator in my apartment with an elderly German. Occasionally, they attempt to make conversation. So I just smile and giggle as if I know what they're saying, then at the end of the ride reply, "Ciao!".</p>

                <h4>Lengfeld</h4>
                <p>I am really quite comfortable here. I'm very relaxed, yet not bored. I love where I live, which is quite fortunate because I've been spending a lot of time here the past couple days. However, I did spend a lot of the weekend outside. Some friends from UBC are working in Stuttgart, about an hour away by train, and they spent the weekend here in Würzburg. We went to visit the infamous Residenz, which was absolutely breathtaking. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%BCrzburg_Residence" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> will do better justice than me, but the Residenz is a palace from the 18th century, almost completely rebuilt after it was destroyed in WWII. There was a lightning storm that night which made for a beautiful display to enjoy with my beer by the river.</p>
                <p>Work is interesting. Today we waited for liquid nitrogen to boil out of the microscope, but since it is insanely thermally insulated, it took 7 hours for it to increase 2 degrees Celsius. In that time, I wrote a short <a href="https://github.com/RyanCotsakis/Elevator" target="_blank">program</a> that simulates an elevator, so that I could test where the elevator should go when there is no one using it, such that there is minimal wait time. The result is that it is marginally better to send the elevator to the ground floor to wait for people to arrive. Also today, I was asked by a physics PHD student how I'd go about solving his ODE numerically. I explained how he could do it in Excel (only because he didn't have MATLAB). At the end of the day he thanked me and showed me how well it turned out.</p>

                <p>A few updates! I have a couple of vacations coming up. My friends and I are going to Konstanz, a German city bordering Switzerland. Then a couple weeks later, I'm visiting Croatia. That's not even the biggest news. Last night I won 2 Euros in a poker tournament with a bunch of locals! The story starts with my buddy Tristan and I arranging to meet up in the city. Patric, my roommate, kindly offered to take me there on the back of his motorcycle. So we rip into town, I find Tristan, and we get wicked burgers and wicked beer at a little restaurant called Burger & Bier. After that we go to his place in Grombühl, which is pretty close to Lengfeld. There were a few guys starting a poker tournament and asked if we wanted to join.</p>
                <p>I haven't even mentioned the biggest news! I have my own page on EP2's <a href="https://www.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ep2/team/ryan_cotsakis/" target="_blank">website</a>. Work is getting real interesting. We are imaging individual atoms with the STM now and trying to decipher how they are arranged and how their spins are oriented. I would love to post some images on this page, but I am not sure if I'm allowed...</p>
                <p>Tomorrow I am going out for a run. I have been telling myself to do so for the past week or so but I just get distracted and write code. I updated the video game that I made a while back, Swarm, which I've described in my <a href="https://ryancotsakis.github.io/aboutme/#projects">Projects</a>. Two or more people can now play over a server. This feature is still a little buggy, but if you want to try it out, and you're using a PC, you can download the latest version <a href="https://github.com/RyanCotsakis/Swarm/raw/master/Swarm.zip">here</a>. I digress. I am going to do the same run I did a few weeks ago. It's really nice it goes by this pond and through the grassy fields by the IKEA. Last time, I found my way to the pond just fine, but I somehow got lost returning home, and ended up running over 10 km in the hills of Lengfeld.</p>
                <p>Last update. Patric's mother has offered to lend me her bicycle for the summer. She is wicked. She even does all my laundry!</p>

                <h4>Lengfeld</h4>
                <p>I have a lot to write about. My apologies for the late entry! I must write today because I won't get the chance to this weekend, and I don't want y'all worrying! I took the day off work today, but I forgot to turn my alarm off, so here I am, awake at 7:15. I took the day off work because today is the day that I hop on a train (at 14:??) with three of my buddies to go to Konstanz. Before then, at noon, I'm going to hit up Burger and Bier mit mein freund Patric, and hopefully pick up his mom's bike.</p>
                <p>Last weekend, almost all of my friends from UBC went to Prague. I didn't go because a) I'm frugal, and b) I had a feeling I'd have a lot of fun in Würzburg. I was right about point b. Remember I said I would go for a run on May 23rd? Well, I didn't. So on the 24th (Father's Day in Germany) I went for a very long run to make up for it. I ran to Erlabrunn, which is 12 kilometers away from my house if you run through a series of foot paths. There are a couple of small lakes at Erlabrunn, so my roommates agreed to take the motorcycle and meet me there. I ran there with nothing but a hand drawn map, and my bus card. After 2 hours of mostly asking for directions, I finally arrived at the lakes. My roommates did shortly thereafter. I asked them to bring my phone, which I decided would be pretty useful to have on the run back. I ran through wheat fields, forests, and narrow European streets. It was great, but tiring!</p>
                <p>I haven't written anything about this here, but we are getting a dog! My roommate found a dog online that hasn't had a home for the first year of her life. Her name is Laika and she's coming on the 11th of this month!</p>
                <p>Last weekend, I also spent a bunch of time w/ some friends that I have made here. We <em>drove</em> to Erlabrunn, where we alternated between swimming and warming up in the hot sun. I asked my buddy Cedrick to sunscreen my back, but he only got my upper back, which became very clear the next day. But anyways, that night, after the lakes, the same group took me to a sort of underground punk concert. It was a really different atmosphere that I had little trouble enjoying. We were right up at the front of the stage, and as I'm being pushed around by friendly punks, I look up and see Cedrick crowd surfing. Later that night he said that if I got on the stage and looked into the crowd, there would be a group of people there ready, and they'd just hoist me into the air. He was so right.</p>
