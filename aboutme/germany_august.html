                <h4>Lengfeld</h4>
                <p>This last month in Germany could very well end up being the most eventful month of my life. The end of July was somewhat relaxed, still lots happened, but it's not like there was a party every day.</p>
                <p>A little while back I started watching Rick and Morty on Netflix. Pat and I watched the only two seasons in just a couple of weeks. As of last Monday, episodes from the third season are being released weekly! Now I have a show to look forward to, which I haven't had since Breaking Bad. However, there's been a lot more going on in my life than just Rick and Morty. Not last friday but the one before, Tristan, Jake, and I went to take a tour of a ground station that communicates with satellites. Some of the satellite dishes there were over 30m in diameter. Also, my shoes basically fell apart the other day. The sole of one of the shoes just started tearing off. I went out yesterday (in my running shoes) and bought some <a href="http://www.adidas.com/us/busenitz-pro-shoes/G48060.html" target="_blank">Busenitz</a>. I also got some pants, shirts, and socks; now it's just underwear that is the limiting factor. My phone started working around the time my bike stopped working; the rice did wonders. My back tire on my bike popped, and so until Pat and I patched it, I had to rely on the busses, which at one point went on strike so I had to walk an hour to work. On Friday, I went to this interesting heavy rock club with Cedrick and Joni, where there were some interesting people… The next evening, Melanie drove Logan and me to her friend David’s place, who was hosting a barbeque party. There’s this German children’s game called Looping Louie that is apparently notorious for being played as a drinking game. We played it at David’s and it was just incredible. On sunday night, some friends and I topped the weekend off with a very filling dinner at Burger and Bier. I could also go into details about the barbeque we hosted at Cedrick and Joni’s place last night, but again, that would make this block of text excessively long.</p>
                <p>Instead, I will write a bit about some of the projects I’ve been working on in the midst of all these plans. Yesterday I gave a talk to my experimental physics research group about the magnetic structure of manganese oxide chains on iridium. It was the first international talk that I had ever given! I spent the last week at work, and the last few days at home creating and fine tuning my presentation. I think it was well worth it too because I received a lot of good feedback after the talk. My free time was split between that and solving a problem in mathematics that has been haunting me ever since I arrived in Germany. The problem has to do with the bus that I take home from work. The bus is never on time, and so I started recording when the bus comes to get a better estimate for when I should arrive at the bus stop. One day, 20 minutes after the hourly bus was supposed to arrive, I got impatient and started to walk home. I wondered how I could include the information (that the bus was more than 20 minutes late) in my statistical analysis. After a lot of thought, I came up with a solution. There’s no way I’ll bore my small audience with the details of <em>how</em>, but for those who are curious, I wrote a short paper called <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B70G2LpVV6N4UllEalhiMEVaU1U" target="_blank">The Statistics of Late Busses</a> which is published nowhere else but on my Google Drive.</p>
                <p>On the agenda for the rest of the month are four trips in four weekends in four different countries. This weekend, I am heading out towards the German Alps to go camping. The campsite is just outside Munich, but we will have a car with us and I anticipate taking day trips out into the city, and possibly the mountains! The next weekend I’m going to Prague for four days. The weekend after that, three days in Amsterdam. I haven’t yet mentioned this on this blog, but the weekend after Amsterdam, my girlfriend comes to visit me! She’ll be staying with me in Würzburg for four nights, and then we’ll hop on a plane to Italy. We have hotels booked in Tuscany, Rome, and on the Amalfi Coast. After Italy, it’s back to Vancouver, and back to real life.</p>
