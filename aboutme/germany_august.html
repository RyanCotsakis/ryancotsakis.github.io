                <h3>August 02, 22:33</h3>
                <h4>Lengfeld</h4>
                <p>This last month in Germany could very well end up being the most eventful month of my life. The end of July was somewhat relaxed, still lots happened, but it's not like there was a party every day.</p>
                <p>A little while back I started watching Rick and Morty on Netflix. Pat and I watched the only two seasons in just a couple of weeks. As of last Monday, episodes from the third season are being released weekly! Now I have a show to look forward to, which I haven't had since Breaking Bad. However, there's been a lot more going on in my life than just Rick and Morty. Not last friday but the one before, Tristan, Jake, and I went to take a tour of a ground station that communicates with satellites. Some of the satellite dishes there were over 30m in diameter. Also, my shoes basically fell apart the other day. The sole of one of the shoes just started tearing off. I went out yesterday (in my running shoes) and bought some <a href="http://www.adidas.com/us/busenitz-pro-shoes/G48060.html" target="_blank">Busenitz</a>. I also got some pants, shirts, and socks; now it's just underwear that is the limiting factor. My phone started working around the time my bike stopped working; the rice did wonders. My back tire on my bike popped, and so until Pat and I patched it, I had to rely on the busses, which at one point went on strike so I had to walk an hour to work. On Friday, I went to this interesting heavy rock club with Cedrick and Joni, where there were some interesting people… The next evening, Melanie drove Logan and me to her friend David’s place, who was hosting a barbeque party. There’s this German children’s game called Looping Louie that is apparently notorious for being played as a drinking game. We played it at David’s and it was just incredible. On sunday night, some friends and I topped the weekend off with a very filling dinner at Burger and Bier. I could also go into details about the barbeque we hosted at Cedrick and Joni’s place last night, but again, that would make this block of text excessively long.</p>
                <p>Instead, I will write a bit about some of the projects I’ve been working on in the midst of all these plans. Yesterday I gave a talk to my experimental physics research group about the magnetic structure of manganese oxide chains on iridium. It was the first international talk that I had ever given! I spent the last week at work, and the last few days at home creating and fine tuning my presentation. I think it was well worth it too because I received a lot of good feedback after the talk. My free time was split between that and solving a problem in mathematics that has been haunting me ever since I arrived in Germany. The problem has to do with the bus that I take home from work. The bus is never on time, and so I started recording when the bus comes to get a better estimate for when I should arrive at the bus stop. One day, 20 minutes after the hourly bus was supposed to arrive, I got impatient and started to walk home. I wondered how I could include the information (that the bus was more than 20 minutes late) in my statistical analysis. After a lot of thought, I came up with a solution. There’s no way I’ll bore my small audience with the details of <em>how</em>, but for those who are curious, I wrote a short paper called <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B70G2LpVV6N4UllEalhiMEVaU1U" target="_blank">The Statistics of Late Busses</a> which is published nowhere else but on my Google Drive.</p>
                <p>On the agenda for the rest of the month are four trips in four weekends in four different countries. This weekend, I am heading out towards the German Alps to go camping. The campsite is just outside Munich, but we will have a car with us and I anticipate taking day trips out into the city, and possibly the mountains! The next weekend I’m going to Prague for four days. The weekend after that, three days in Amsterdam. I haven’t yet mentioned this on this blog, but the weekend after Amsterdam, my girlfriend comes to visit me! She’ll be staying with me in Würzburg for four nights, and then we’ll hop on a plane to Italy. We have hotels booked in Tuscany, Rome, and on the Amalfi Coast. After Italy, it’s back to Vancouver, and back to real life.</p>

                <h4>Lengfeld</h4>
                <p>I’m back from the first of my four big weekend adventures in August. Friday Morning, I woke up nice and early and met Melanie and Logan in town at 6:00. From there, Melanie drove us to a campsite on the shore of Lake Starnberg, a little south of Munich. We had all of Friday and Saturday to spend swimming in the lake, chilling beside the lake, eating good food and drinking lots of beer. On the saturday we rented bikes and took them around the lake, resulting in something like a 50 km bike ride. The next morning we packed up camp and headed to Munich, where we spent the afternoon walking around town sightseeing and finding a place to buy a döner. With our stomachs full, the trip ended that evening with a music filled drive home to Würzburg.</p>
                <p>The next day, Logan, Jake and I made quesadillas and watched the aftermath of Rick turning himself into a pickle. Pickle Rick!</p>

                <h4>Lengfeld</h4>
                <p>My stay in Germany is coming to a close and it’s really starting to hit me. This will be one of my last couple blog entries, and I’d like to outline what it is that I’ve been doing on a day to day basis and write a little bit about my weekend in Prague.</p>
                <p>A normal weekday for me here starts with me bussing to work at around 8:40. I share an office with the two phD students, Martin and Matthias, with whom I have been conducting my research. At 11:30, I meet up with my Canadian friends every day at the cafeteria for my favourite meal of the day. They cycle through some amazing dishes and it’s new every time. Today I had a salmon lasagna there for the first time in my life (actually two because Rory didn’t like his). When at work, I spend half my time in my office doing analysis, and the other half of the time working the scanning tunneling microscope in the basement. After about 8 hours of work, I either take the bus home or Martin really kindly offers me a ride.</p>
                <p>Last weekend, I visited Prague with Tristan and Logan. Thursday night we threw a party at Tristan’s for the sake of partying, and Friday night we caught an overnight bus that went directly to Prague. When we arrived on Saturday morning, we checked out the city, got breakfast, saw a castle, and played a game of Friends of Gas. Tristan had already been to Prague in May, and he suggested that we visit this techno club called The Retro. There wasn’t really anything <em>retro</em> about it, it was just very high energy. The next morning we stopped by a little café by our hostel, where we invited our server to get all you can eat Indian food later. Believe it or not, she agreed! We left the café and our new friend and took a train to Plzeň, the city where Pilsner comes from. We had amazing food, amazing beer, and saw some really amazing stuff including a view of the entire city from the top of a cathedral. The next day, we played some ping pong, met some people at our hostel, filled ourselves with Indian food, then met up with Julia the server we had met previously. She took us to what was voted to be the second ugliest building in the world, where they had minigolf just outside. We indulged in a game of that before going to a couple of bars in the evening along with our friends from the hostel. All in all it was a pretty fantastic trip!</p>
                <p>I must conclude my story here because I am leaving for Amsterdam at 23:05, and I still have to pack and get to the train station!</p>

                <h3>August 30, 22:50</h3>
                <h4>Frankfurt / Florence</h4>
                <p>Last night I said goodbye to some of the best friends I have. And just as I was in my first blog entry, I am writing this last entry while soaring through the sky, this time leaving Germany behind me. I’m very saddened by the fact that I won’t see my friends for another long while. <em>I have been deeply affected by so many of you, and I’ll miss you all so much.</em> I have still to write about my trip to Amsterdam and about my first few days with Kate in Würzburg.</p>
                <p>One of the most beautiful cities I have visited thus far is Amsterdam. My recent visit to Amsterdam was the closest I felt to being in Vancouver in four months. The main thing that distinguished the city from Vancouver was the sheer number of bicycles. Getting hit by a bicycle was a greater concern than getting hit by a car while crossing the street. Tristan, Jake, and I met up on Friday night and took an overnight bus to the Netherlands. Saturday morning we walked around the city, enjoyed some breakfast, then some beers, all before checking into our hostel at 14:00. Later that day, we met up with Rory and his girlfriend and visited the Van Gogh museum. It was all cool and all but there’s only so much art you can appreciate inside of an hour. By far one of the highlights of the trip was the day trip to Haarlem on Sunday. We went to the beach, and for half an hour or so, we played in the North Sea, getting tossed around by the tremendous waves. We visited a neat little funk / jazz club that opened at 23:30 that night. It was quite easily the best club I had ever been to. The DJs succeeded in giving me the shivers at least a dozen times.</p>
                <p>A short week of work brought me to my first very saddening goodbye with my coworkers on the Friday. In contrast, the next morning I greeted Kate at the train station after the four months that we were apart. I had a wonderful time showing her around Würzburg, integrating her into my network of friends, and even visiting Bamberg on the Monday (which was a beautiful day) where we tried Bamberg’s smoked beer and enjoyed the sun. Yesterday, we visited Erlabrunn for the last time with Cedrick, Joni, and Alex. They threw a party for me at their place, an unbelievable one at that. <em>Thank you so much guys!</em> We partied until about 5:00, even though our flight departed from Frankfurt at 11:20. We were very worried this morning that we would miss our flight…</p>
                <p>So yes, now we have a ten or so day tour through Italy, just me and Kate. It’s the start of a new journey, and the end of a truly amazing one.
