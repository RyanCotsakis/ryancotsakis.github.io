                <h4>Lengfeld</h4>
                <p>I have a lot to write about. My apologies for the late entry! I must write today because I won't get the chance to this weekend, and I don't want y'all worrying! I took the day off work today, but I forgot to turn my alarm off, so here I am, awake at 7:15. I took the day off work because today is the day that I hop on a train (at 14:??) with three of my buddies to go to Konstanz. Before then, at noon, I'm going to hit up Burger and Bier mit mein freund Patric, and hopefully pick up his mom's bike.</p>
                <p>Last weekend, almost all of my friends from UBC went to Prague. I didn't go because a) I'm frugal, and b) I had a feeling I'd have a lot of fun in Würzburg. I was right about point b. Remember I said I would go for a run on May 23rd? Well, I didn't. So on the 24th (Father's Day in Germany) I went for a very long run to make up for it. I ran to Erlabrunn, which is 12 kilometers away from my house if you run through a series of foot paths. There are a couple of small lakes at Erlabrunn, so my roommates agreed to take the motorcycle and meet me there. I ran there with nothing but a hand drawn map, and my bus card. After 2 hours of mostly asking for directions, I finally arrived at the lakes. My roommates did shortly thereafter. I asked them to bring my phone, which I decided would be pretty useful to have on the run back. I ran through wheat fields, forests, and narrow European streets. It was great, but tiring!</p>
                <p>I haven't written anything about this here, but we are getting a dog! My roommate found a dog online that hasn't had a home for the first year of her life. Her name is Laika and she's coming on the 11th of this month!</p>
                <p>Last weekend, I also spent a bunch of time w/ some friends that I have made here. We <em>drove</em> to Erlabrunn, where we alternated between swimming and warming up in the hot sun. I asked my buddy Cedrick to sunscreen my back, but he only got my upper back, which became very clear the next day. But anyways, that night, after the lakes, the same group took me to a sort of underground punk concert. It was a really different atmosphere that I had little trouble enjoying. We were right up at the front of the stage, and as I'm being pushed around by friendly punks, I look up and see Cedrick crowd surfing. Later that night he said that if I got on the stage and looked into the crowd, there would be a group of people there ready, and they'd just hoist me into the air. He was so right.</p>

                <h3>June 07, 21:45</h3>
                <h4>Lengfeld</h4>
                <p>I found out that getting sick feels the same in Germany, but getting sunburnt does not. Last weekend hosted my trip to Konstanz. Rory Cochrane, Tristan Ford, and Jake Goddard all deserve a huge shout out for making the best of the worst and being there for me when I really needed them.</p>
                <p>Before I start with the trip, I should mention that I made a card game the other day, and just before I had to leave, I was wasting time writing <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B70G2LpVV6N4XzlIekV3Wk5pWms?usp=sharing" target="_blank">the rules</a>. I had almost no time to pack, but luckily I remembered everything. So the 5 hour train ride to Konstanz goes very smoothly (literaly, the train was silent), and I can already tell that my buddies and I are going to have a great time. When we get there its already about 21:00, and all we have time to do is go to a not so great club, and get lost on the way home.</p>
                <p>The next day, we got up and rented a canoe for a few hours. We paddled for about an hour and a half to this wonderful little restaurant, where I had possibly the best fish of my life. After a beer and a swim, we then hopped back in the canoe and made our way back, which I should mention was down a river that divided Germany from Switzerland. By the time we got back to our hostel, we noticed that we all got a decent amount of sun. We also noticed that we had four new roommates, who were all very cool and went out with us that night. They joined us for a drinking game at the hostel, a couple games of pool at a bar, and a nice sit by the moonlit river.</p>
                <p>The next day we went into town and saw Konstanz's equivalent of Stanley Park. It was really lovely. I wish I remember more of what we did on this day, but sadly I cannot. I think there was just too much that happened the next day to keep it all in my head.</p>
                <p>So the next day, we followed through with our spontaneous plan to go to Switzerland. There is technically a border to cross because Switzerland is not in the European Union, but no one was within a kilometer to prevent us from walking ten steps from a German street, to a Swiss street. After hanging out in Switzerland for a bit, we had two hours until our train back to Würzburg. We made our way back to Konstanz, and on our way there, my shoulder started getting annoyingly itchy. After ten minutes, it was painfully itchy. By the time we had gotten into a familiar restaurant in Konstanz, my whole back was itchy as well. I excused myself and hurried off to the washroom were I was able to take my shirt off and pour water on myself. I had a burning itchy pain at this point and the water was only making it worse. I put my shirt back on, ran out to where my friends were sitting and told them how much pain I was in and bent down so they could scratch my back. I made enough of a commotion to attract a very nice lady who helped handle the situation very well. She brought ice which immediately soothed the spot where she applied it on my back. She got me to lie down on a bench where some old guy was sitting, and got Jake to call the paramedics. When the ambulance came, they asked me some questions, took my shirt off again in the middle of the restaurant, and helped me to the ambulance. I don't know why, but they took the ice away... My whole body was shaking due to the pain that that had caused. Finally after they realized that spraying alcohol on my back wasn't working, they reapplied ice, and drove me to the hospital. I could bare the pain now that there was ice on my back, and luckily, for the next four hours as I waited to see a doctor, everything slowly started to feel better. The doctor comes in, and looks very annoyed as she says to me, "You have a sunburn and there's nothing I can do". That's basically how my story with her ends. She gives me some pain killers, and sends me out the door. To my surprise, Rory, Tristan, and Jake are waiting for me in the waiting room! This is about 3 hours <em>after</em> our train left. I was feeling well enough to walk without the ice, and so we all walked around trying to find Wi-Fi so that we could book a trip home. We found a night bus that went from 23:40 to 11:00 the next day. Since it was only about 16:00 at this point, we had a lot of unexpected time to kill. We got dinner, and met a traveler of Europe who called himself "Me High", then waited for our bus. I found out then that I had gotten what's called <a href="http://www.healthline.com/health/outdoor-health/sunburn-itch-relief-hells-itch#overview1" target="_blank">Hell's Itch</a>.</p>
                <p>The next morning we got off the bus, I went home, found a ton of feathers in my flat, fell asleep immediately, and woke up with a cold. I've had one additional sleep since then and now I'm feeling pretty fine. What a weekend.</p>

                <h4>Slovenia / Croatia</h4>
                <p>As promised, we got our dog! I don't have any suitable pictures of her so the next best thing is this smiley picture of Alex before he broke his arm and sprained his other wrist. I'll get to that, but first I will describe what it's like living with my new flatmate, Laika. She is one year old, rescued from the streets of Italy found half starved to death. I have been told that there is an abundance of stray dogs in Italy, and there are organizations even in Germany that help cope with this issue by finding the dogs owners. They found Oana, my roommate, and so now we are raising Laika until potentially a more permanent family wants to raise her. I should add that Patric's mother has expressed interest in this, but only until <em>after</em> we potty train her.</p>
                <p>Here's where I introduce Alex. Last weekend, I went to a music festival with some friends who I met through my roommates, and their friend Alex. The festival was really nice. We camped there for two nights, which I would say was the best part of the whole experience. There was so much noise around the campground all day and all night. Both nights I slept in my tent with nothing between me and the hard packed grass but a sleeping bag. There was a lot of booze, and with that a lot of people who were very interested in talking to me. I met so many different people, and every single one of them celebrated with me the fact that we didn't share a common culture or first language. All over the camping ground, people (who I didn't even know) would yell out at me, "Canada!"</p>
                <p>The music was predominantly rock, and it was pretty exciting. Of course for every band that played there was a group of people pushing each other around for the sheer thrill of it. On the second day of the festival, Alex was pushed out of one of these mosh pits, and broke his arm. We had no idea that he left the festival immediately after the incident, and just assumed that he had met up with some other people. I found out the next morning that Alex was in the hospital, and so since the festival was over anyways, it was a no-brainer to pack up and head over to him. We played half a game of <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B70G2LpVV6N4XzlIekV3Wk5pWms?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Friends of Gas</a>. It was a great opportunity to learn which rules needed to be refined, and I have made the game as perfect as it's going to get.</p>
                <p>Work is getting cool! We've collected seemingly contradictory data, and we've been trying to wrap our heads around how we could possibly be seeing what we are seeing. My day consists of theorizing, and a lot of preparing samples for the microscope. Indeed, this coming week, I will be left on my own to do the experiments and figure everything out for myself.</p>
                <p>So I'm on a bus that just crossed over the border from Slovenia to Croatia. My friend Katelyn and I took a ride share to Stuttgart, where ten UBC students and I caught our bus at 22:30 last night. I spent the night sound asleep dreaming about work, and the morning we spent a short time hanging out and eating cake in Bled, Slovenia. I met a guy on the bus named Pradeep, and I am thrilled that he will be rooming with me, the others from our Konstanz trip, and our friend Logan while we stay in Zagreb, Croatia. I can already tell this will be an awesome experience.</p>

                <h4>Lengfeld</h4>
                <p>I'll pick up just shortly after where I left off. That night, after we had arrived in Zagreb, we enjoyed many drinks at the hostel we were staying at, and went out to see what the nightlife was like in Croatia. From what I remember, it was a good time! Jake and I left the group a little early to head back to the hostel, which was probably the best decision that we could have made at the time. We were relatively well rested for the visit to the national park in the morning.</p>
                <p>The park was amazing. It had so much to offer. There were waterfalls, caves, swamps, and forests. The water was incredibly clear and blue, but we were devastated to learn that swimming was prohibited. This did not deter us from seeking out a discrete location where we could take a quick dip. With only an hour or so left before we had to make our way back to Zagreb, three of my buddies and I decided it was as good of a time as ever to hop in the lake. I have no idea how, but I guess there was just enough noise and nudity to attract the attention of our friend from across the lake, who yelled at the top of their lungs, "Ryan, get out of the lake!" Scared that we would get caught by someone who had more authority, we hurried out of the water and headed back to the bus. It was definitely the highlight of Croatia, as I got everything I'd hoped for from the Plitvice lakes.</p>
                <p>After another night in Zagreb, we made our way over to Ljubljana, Slovenia (try saying that ten times fast). We had a whole day to do whatever we want then the bus was to make its way back to Munich at around midnight. The culture in Ljubljana was so vibrant. There was music everywhere, people everywhere, a wine festival that spanned pretty much everywhere, and really good food everywhere. My friends and I found this one amazing white wine that was selling for 5 euros per bottle. We all had at least one to ourselves as we sat and talked by the river. I bought myself an ice-cream; waffle flavour on a chocolate waffle cone. After one bite, I knew that this was the best ice-cream cone that I'd ever had in my whole life, and so I said exactly that to my friends. A short while later, I was walking back from the washroom, and I passed by this guy who was eating what looked like the same ice-cream flavour. No word of a lie, he turns to his friend and says, "This is the best ice-cream cone I've ever had in my whole life." I immediately introduced myself to him, and he confirmed that he was indeed eating the waffle flavour. He was from Toronto, so we start talking and I bring him and his buddy over to our group. We celebrated Slovenia with more wine and a wicked dinner.</p>
                <p>The next day, in Würzburg, it's time for me to independently carry out all of my experiments for the week. I merely touch the microscope, and a part of the linear transfer mechanism comes loose and falls into the bottom of the preparation chamber. The prep chamber is an ultra-high vacuum (10<sup>-11</sup> mbar), so in order to fix it, we had to bring it to atmospheric pressure. That was the easy part. The hard part is getting it back down to 10<sup>-11</sup> mbar. It took all week, and I had absolutely nothing to do.</p>
                <p>I have spent a lot of time this week with my friends Cedrick and Joni. They love my card game, and so we played it again with Alex and their new flatmate Roby. We had a couple of barbecues, went to Erlabrunn yesterday, and now today they're going to show me the skate park here in Würzburg. Cedrick has a skateboard so I'm going to see if I can teach them a few tricks.</p>
                
                <h3>June 27, 15:51</h3>
                <h4>University of Würzburg</h4>
                <p>Just a quick update as I wait for the microscope's tip to approach the sample:</p>
                <p>We didn't end up going to the skatepark. Instead, Cedrick, Joni, and I played some Call of Duty Zombies and then skateboarded just outside their flat. They invited me to play a game of football (soccer) with them. They have a sort of beer league, and they needed someone to fill in for Alex. So, I go back to my flat to get dressed for the game, and I find out that Laika had been moved to a different family a couple hundred kilometers away. Sadly, I won't be seeing her again. But it's a good thing that Laika has a new family. Our little apartment was too small for her, and it was too big of a commitment for the three of us to give her the attention that she needed.</p>
                <p>The football game was fun. I didn't come close to scoring, as this was my first football game since grade 10 PE. However, I did <em>almost</em> get a couple of assists!</p>
