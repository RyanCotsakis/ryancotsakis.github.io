                <p>In the Summer of 2018, I was working in the <a href="http://mistlab.ca/" target="_blank">MIST Lab</a> in Montréal researching decentralized algorithms for the cooperative transport of fabrics using micro-UAVs. The lab uses a novel programming language called <a href="https://github.com/MISTLab/Buzz" target="_blank">Buzz</a> to implement decentralized algorithms for swarm robotics. I integrated Buzz (which is compiled with a C compiler) in Python to interface with the Crazyflies via the Crazyradio dongle. Finally, I created PyBuzz, a software architecture to test novel collaborative transport algorithms with the Crazyflies. I summarized my results in a paper that I presented at the 2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).</p>

                <p>From May until September of 2017, I worked alongside graduate students performing physics research at the University of Würzburg. We were investigating the electronic structure of spin-orbit–coupled surfaces with atomic spatial resolution. We used a Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM) to image the atoms on the surfaces of the substrates, and it was my responsibility to operate the STM and to decipher how the spins were oriented on the surface of the samples. I suggested the idea that MnO chains have a chiral magnetic structure, which is the main finding in our team's publication in Nature Communications.</p>

                <p>Grin Technologies was the perfect place to have my first engineering co-op. Grin manufactures and sells electric bicycle conversion kits which are made in-house. Not only did I gain a sweet electric bicycle from Grin, but I learned an uncountable number of skills as a software engineer, electrical engineer, electronics manufacturer, metal shop worker, and bike technician.</p>
                <p>I started a project that took real-time serial data and updated a user interface, all independently, all in Python. Grin accompanied the software I was working on with a simple electrical device, and I had a hand in designing its circuitry. This device, the Battery Grinspector, is now manufactured and sold by Grin. I learned how solder, crimp wires, populate PCBs and test the products we were producing. I also became very familiar with the tools in the metal shop. I was constantly fabricating parts on the milling machine, band saw, drill press, and CNC machine. I spent a week or two constructing a wooden deck that spanned over 50 feet, and I gained technical experience in the maintenance and assembly of bicycles. I laced and trued many wheels for many customers and indeed for my own electric bike!</p>

                <p>Given a set of points, it is extremely useful for applications like machine learning to have a computer partition the points into clusters of high density. A classmate and I used a concept from topological data analysis called <em>persistence</em> to categorize points into clusters. The algorithm automatically decides how to assign these clusters with no user input, but also allows the user to manually change parameters. We have implemented our algorithm as an extension of TTK, and we worked directly with the creators of TTK to achieve this.</p>

                <p>Five of my classmates and I were granted $10,000 to found a business that would transform exercise tracking. Our team's vision was to create a product that could be installed at the gym to track the gym users' exercises, and feed that information to their smartphones. To prove that this was a viable concept, we created a prototype that could recognize 10 different exercises using machine learning and computer vision. We were the only project in Engineering Physics to win the Industry Award, granted by UBC Applied Science. Here is an excerpt from our final reccomendation report:</p>
                <p>"Once connected to a computer with the corresponding software, the user can begin recording with the Xbox Kinect. The user must then input their unique user id into the software. The user can then stand about two meters away from the camera, and begin any one of the 10 allowable exercises with any of the 3 allowable weights at any time. Shortly after the user stops exercising, the system will send to an online database the exercise they did, along with information about the weight and number of repetitions. The user can walk in and out of frame as they please, and can begin any other exercise thereafter."</p>

                <h4>Winner</h4>
                <p>My three teammates and I won the 2016 Engineering Physics robot competiton. Our challenge was to make a miniature autonomous taxi robot that could locate and pick up stuffed dolls that emmited an IR signal, and drop them off at some specified location. Our robot was built from raw materials cut on a water jet cutter and a laser cutter. All of the electrical circuits were soldered onto PCBs and installed in our robot. I designed most of the signal processing circuits as well an also built the power transmission circuits. I also made a large contribution to the codebase as well. I mostly attribute our success to the fact that our team carried a variety of skills, and it was our ability to work in a team that led us to win the competition.</p>

                <h3>Swarm</h3>
                <h4>A Video Game I Created</h4>
                <p>During one of my reading breaks, I set out to make my first video game. The game is written in Python, and the GUI was created with pygame. I started writing Swarm with hopes of making it playable on a Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), so I made the game such that can be played using only 7 buttons. The game was "finished" well before I modified it for the SNES, but to do so, I had to get around the SNES controller timing protocol. Every 20 ms, the SNES sends the controller a portion of a 83 kHz square wave, and on a different line, the controller sends back a high pulse during the first period of the square wave if "B" is pressed, the second period if "Y" is pressed, and so on for each button on the controller. My Raspberry Pi could not read the GPIO pins fast enough to correctly distinguish which buttons were being pushed, so I had to program an FPGA to convert this timing protocol into 7 wires running to my Pi, where each wire was logic high if its corresponding button was pressed, and low otherwise. It worked like a charm!</p>
                <p>When I finished the SNES project, I still continued to update the PC game. I have spent a lot of time playing it, so much so in fact, that my high score is Level 21. You can download the latest version below. I have recently updated the game such that it can be played over one's home network with another PC. The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/RyanCotsakis/Swarm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <p>It was my first year in university that I learnt how to write code. I took an "Introduction to programming with C" course, and from the skills I learnt in that course alone, I started my own projects for the fun of it. I wrote a chess opponent (<a href="https://github.com/ryancotsakis/chess" target="_blank">Chess</a>), a Suduko solver (<a href="https://github.com/ryancotsakis/sudoku" target="_blank">Sudoku</a>), and a maze generator (<a href="https://github.com/ryancotsakis/corn-maze" target="_blank">Corn-Maze</a>) all written in C.</p>
                <p>I should outline one more of my software projects in a little more detail, namely my <a href="https://github.com/ryancotsakis/cryptography" target="_blank">Cryptography</a> repository. It encrypts and decrypts .txt files using a user defined password. I created the encryption algorithm myself, and as I learn more about cryptography, the more I am surprised to see how much similarity there is between my algorithm and existing encryption algorithms. Currently, it's the only software on which I use to store all of my passwords.
                <p>While living in Montréal, I worked on a project that I called <a href="https://github.com/RyanCotsakis/PyPoker", target="_blank">PyPoker</a>. It's a neural network that is capable of playing Texas Hold'em against itself, and creating a winning betting strategy that it uses against a human player in a simulated game environment.</p>

The problem is easily solved via the technique of Vieta jumping, but Vieta jumping was invented as a result of this problem. I found another way around the problem, and I wrote a proof that can be found via the link below:</p>

I graduated with a minor in honours mathematics and a specialization in electrical engineering. Eng Phys is the most intensive, and competitive engineering program offered at UBC, partly due to the number of credits we had to take, but also the amount of math and physics we take is comparable to a major in just that field. The first large project course in Engineering Physics is the Engineering Physics robot competition described above. For the second project course, we founded Increment Fitness. I graduated with an average of 87%, and more importantly, I really enjoyed my experience at UBC. Check out the link on the left for more information about Engineering Physics.
