                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <h4>A Day in the Life</h4>
                <p>Five years in Engineering and I'm still smiling... Here's a bit about how I manage that. I grew up and spent the first 3 years of my degree in the suburbs, North Delta, so I spent a lot of time going to and from school. Now, my living situation changes more frequently than I update this website. I enjoy commuting on my electric bicycle, and taking the bus when the weather's no good. On my free time, I love to think about mathematics and discuss it with my friends at school; but I also enjoy letting my friends back home take my mind off of it. I'm usually pretty busy juggling school, friends, and miscellaneous engineering projects, but it beats being bored! I also really enjoy skateboarding, programming, jogging, and hiking.</p>
                <h4>My Skills</h4>
                <p>I have excellent analytical skills. I do math for fun, and I have a document full of original ideas on my laptop. I would like to move my career towards managing a technical team, as I have been successful in fulfilling that role in various projects. I can write in Python, MATLAB, and Java. I gained much experience with electronics while working in a team of four to build an autonomous robot, and also while manufacturing electric bicycles at Grin Technologies. I enjoyed the opportunity to be a part of a research group in Germany, where I was looking at atoms with an STM. Just last Summer I was researching decentralized cooperative transport algorithms in Montréal. I am well trained to work in a machine shop, and for what it's worth, I can also juggle and do a standing backflip (not at the same time).</p>

                <h3>Swarm Robotics Research</h3>
                <h4>Polytechnique Montréal</h4>
                <p>Just last Summer, I was working in the <a href="http://mistlab.ca/" target="_blank">MIST Lab</a> in Montréal researching decentralized algorithms for the cooperative transport of fabrics using micro-UAVs. The lab uses a novel programming language called <a href="https://github.com/MISTLab/Buzz" target="_blank">Buzz</a> to implement decentralized algorithms for swarm robotics. My job was to integrate this language (which is compiled with a C compiler) in Python so that I could send instructions from Buzz to the Crazyflie micro-UAVs over a radio dongle that is interfaced with through Python. I designed the system architecture for what I call PyBuzz, which allows one to step through Buzz scripts from within a Python script, and simulate the communication between robots on one or multiple Linux machines. Using PyBuzz, I implemented and tested novel collaborative transport algorithms with the Crazyflies. At the end of the experience, I summarized my results in a paper submitted to the 2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). The paper was accepted, and I will be flying to Montréal this May to present my work. I also published a preprint on Arxiv, which can be accessed through the link below.</p>

                <h4>University of Würzburg, Germany</h4>
                <p>From May until September of 2017, I worked alongside graduate students performing physics research at the University of Würzburg. We were investigating the electronic structure of spin-orbit–coupled surfaces with atomic spatial resolution. We used a Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM) to image the atoms on the surfaces of the substrates, and it was my responsibility to operate the STM and to decipher how the spins were oriented on the surface of the samples. The team has put together a paper that is currently under review by Nature Communications, and in that paper is a discussion about my finding that MnO chains have a chiral magnetic structure on Ir(100).</p>

                <h4>Electrical, Software, and Shop Technician</h4>
                <p>I worked at Grin Technologies for my first engineering co-op. There I had one of the best work experiences I could have asked for. Grin manufactures and sells their own electric bicycle conversion kits. Not only did I gain a sweet electric bicycle from Grin, but I learnt an almost uncountable number of skills. My position at the workplace was one of a software engineer, electrical engineer, electronics manufacturer, metal shop worker, handyman, and bike technician.</p>
                <p>Before Grin, I hadn't ever written code in Python. But after only a few days I started a project that took real time serial data and updated a user interface, all independently, all in Python. Grin accompanied the software I was working on with a simple electrical device, and I had a hand in designing the circuitry for that device. This device, the Battery Grinspector, is soon to be released. I learnt how solder, crimp wires, populate PCBs, and test the products we were producing. I also became very familiar with the tools in the metal shop. I was constantly fabricating parts on the milling machine, band saw, drill press, and CNC machine. I did a few renovations at work too; for instance I demolished an office to make more space for the warehouse, and I spent a week or two constructing a wooden deck that spanned over 50 feet. I also gained some very technical experience in the maintenance and assembly of bicycles. I laced and trued many wheels for many customers and indeed for my own electric bike!</p>

                <h4>Topological Data Analysis Clustering Algorithm</h4>
                <p>Given a set of points, it is extremely useful for applications like machine learning to have a computer partition the points into clusters of high density. Just recently, a classmate and I used a concept from topological data analysis called <em>persistence</em> to categorize points into clusters. The algorithm automatically decides how to assign these clusters with no user input, but also allows the user to manually change parameters. We have implemented our algorithm as an extension of TTK, and we worked directly with the creators of TTK to achieve this.</p>

                <p>Five of my classmates and I were granted $10,000 to help start a business that would transform exercise tracking. For our second project course in Engineering Physics, we developed a prototype of a technology that with further development can be installed at any gym that tracks gym users' exercises with minimal effort from the user. The idea is that one would be able to download an app that we are creating, go to the gym, workout, and have all of their workout information logged on their phone without any manual entry of information. We were the only project in Engineering Physics to win the Industry Award, granted by UBC Applied Science. Here is an excerpt from our final reccomendation report:</p>
                <p>"Once connected to a computer with the corresponding software, the user can begin recording with the Kinect. The user must then input their unique user id into the software. The user can then stand about two meters away from the camera, and begin any one of the 10 allowable exercises with any of the 3 allowable weights at any time. Shortly after the user stops exercising, the system will send to an online database the exercise they did, along with information about the weight and number of repetitions. The user can walk in and out of frame as they please, and can begin any other exercise thereafter."</p>

                <h4>Winner</h4>
                <p>My three teammates and I won the 2016 Engineering Physics robot competiton. Our challenge, which varies from year to year, was to make a miniature autonomous taxi robot that could pick up stuffed dolls that were emitting an IR signal, and drop them off at some specified location. Our robot, named Jett Pace, was built from raw materials cut on a water jet cutter. All of the electrical circuits were soldered onto PCBs and installed in our robot. I designed most of the signal processing circuits as well an also built the power transmission circuits. I also made a large contribution to the code as well. I mostly attribute our success to the fact that our team carried a variety of skills, and it was our ability to work in a team that lead us to win the competition. Please see our <a href="https://danielchawla.github.io/jett-pace-webpage/" target="_blank">web page</a> for more details.</p>

                <h3>Swarm</h3>
                <h4>A Video Game I Created</h4>
                <p>During one of my reading breaks, I set out to make my first video game. The game is written in Python, and the GUI was created with pygame. I started writing Swarm, with hopes of making it playable on a Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES); so I made the game such that can be played using only 7 buttons. The game was "finished" well before I modified it for the SNES, but to do so, I had to get around the SNES controller timing protocol. Every 20 ms, the SNES sends the controller a portion of a 83 kHz square wave, and on a different line, the controller sends back a high pulse during the first period of the square wave if "B" is pressed, the second period if "Y" is pressed, and so on for each button on the controller. My Raspberry Pi could not read the GPIO pins fast enough to correctly distinguish which buttons were being pushed, so I had to program an FPGA to convert this timing protocol into 7 wires running to my Pi, where each wire was logic high if its corresponding button was pressed, and low otherwise. It worked like a charm!</p>
                <p>When I finished the SNES project, I still continued to update the PC game. I have spent a lot of time playing it, so much so in fact, that my high score is Level 21. You can download the latest version below. I have recently updated the game such that it can be played over one's home network with another PC (This feature is in its early stages; it may be buggy). The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/RyanCotsakis/Swarm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <p>It was my first year in university that I learnt how to write code. I took an "Introduction to programming with C" course, and from the skills I learnt in that course alone, I started my own projects for the fun of it. I wrote a chess opponent (<a href="https://github.com/ryancotsakis/chess" target="_blank">Chess</a>), a Suduko solver (<a href="https://github.com/ryancotsakis/sudoku" target="_blank">Sudoku</a>), and a maze generator (<a href="https://github.com/ryancotsakis/corn-maze" target="_blank">Corn-Maze</a>) all written in C.</p>
                <p>I should outline one more of my software projects in a little more detail, namely my <a href="https://github.com/ryancotsakis/cryptography" target="_blank">Cryptography</a> repository. It encrypts and decrypts .txt files using a user defined password. I created the encryption algorithm myself, and as I learn more about cryptography, the more I am surprised to see how much similarity there is between my algorithm and existing encryption algorithms. Currently, it's the only software on which I use to store all of my passwords. Inspired by the German code used in WWII, I named it <a href="https://github.com/RyanCotsakis/Cryptography" target="_blank">Enigma</a>.</p>
                <p>An additional project that I was working on while I was in Montréal is called <a href="https://github.com/RyanCotsakis/PyPoker", target="_blank">PyPoker</a>. Here, I built a neural network that is capable of playing Texas Hold'em against itself, and creating a winning betting strategy that it can use against a human player in a simulated game environment.</p>

                <p>I mentioned above that I love mathematics. I am choosing to include this miscellaneous project on my page because I spent a considerable amount of time on this project. I was on YouTube, and I came across this video that described a very tough problem in number theory. I set out to solve this problem, and it consumed a lot of my time. The problem is supposedly easily solved via the technique of Vieta jumping, but Vieta jumping was invented as a result of this problem. I found another way around the problem, and I wrote a proof that can be found via the link below:</p>

                <p>Unlike the previous math problem that I spent a lot of time solving, I formulated this one myself. I was waiting for a bus in Germany, and it was so late that I gave up waiting for it, and walked home instead. I wondered how I could use this event to better estimate, on average, how late the bus comes. I wrote this short paper on how one can include measurements with varying uncertainties and partially measured measurements to best estimate the parameters of a continuous random variable in a statistical analysis.</p>

                <p>While living in Würzburg, I developed a board game that can be played with a deck of cards and some other household items. The idea behind the game is that the 13 card values are assigned different abilities, and each one helps the player obtain more money to buy more cards. I am not <em>too</em> ashamed to share my nerdy invention because out of the ten or so people who have played the game, most enjoyed it enough to play it a second time.

                <h3>Engineering Physics</h3>
                <h4>Graduate Representative</h4>
                <p>I am in my fifth and final year of Engineering Physics at UBC, representing the entire graduate class in the Engineering Physics Undergraduate Society. Eng Phys is the most intensive, and competitive engineering program offered at UBC, partly due the number of credits we have to take, but also the amount of math and physics we take is comparable to a major in just that field. In fact, because I have taken extra MATH and ELEC courses, I will be graduating with a minor in honours mathematics and a specialization in electrical engineering. The first large project course in Engineering Physics is the Engineering Physics robot competition described above. For the second project course, we founded Increment Fitness. I am currently maintaining an average of 88% in all of my classes, and I think more importantly, I'm really enjoying them. Check out the link on the left for more information about Engineering Physics. The link on the right I'm leaving here to exemplify the depth of physics that Engineering Physics encourages.</p>
