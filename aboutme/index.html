                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <h4>A Day in the Life</h4>
                <p>I live in the suburbs, North Delta, so I spend a lot of time going to and from school. I enjoy commuting on my electric bicycle, and taking the bus when the weather's no good. On my free time, I love to think about mathematics, discuss it with my friends at school; but I also enjoy letting my friends at home take my mind off of it. I'm usually pretty busy juggling school, friends, a girlfriend, and a long commute, but it beats being bored! I also really enjoy skateboarding, programming, and hiking.</p>
                <h4>My Skills</h4>
                <p>I am proficient in Java, Python, C, MATLAB, HTML, and CSS. I gained much experience with electrical circuits while working in a team of four to build an autonomous robot, and while manufacturing electric bicycles at Grin Technologies. I am well trained to work in a machine shop and wood shop, and I also have experience working in a laboratory setting. I can juggle and do a standing backflip (not at the same time).</p>

                <h3>Grin Technologies</h3>
                <h4>Electrical, Software, and Shop Technician</h4>
                <p>At Grin Technologies, I had one of the best work experiences I could have asked for. Grin manufactures and sells their own electric bicycle conversion kits. Not only did I gain a sweet electric bicycle from Grin, but I learnt an almost uncountable number of skills. My position at the workplace was one of a software engineer, electrical engineer, electronics manufacturer, metal shop worker, handyman, and bike technician.</p>
                <p>Before Grin, I hadn't ever written code in Python. But after only a few days I started a project that took real time serial data and updated a user interface, all independently, all in Python. Grin accompanied the software I was working on with a simple electrical device, and I had a hand in designing the circuitry for that device. This device, the Battery Grinspector, is soon to be released. I learnt how solder, crimp wires, populate PCBs, and test the products we were producing. I also became very familiar with the tools in the metal shop. I was constantly fabricating parts on the milling machine, band saw, drill press, and CNC machine. I did a few renovations at work too; for instance I demolished an office to make more space for the warehouse, and I spent a week or two constructing a wooden deck that spanned over 50 feet. I also gained some very technical experience in the maintenance and assembly of bicycles. I laced and trued many wheels for many customers and indeed for my own electric bike!</p>

                <h3>Autonomous Robot Competition</h3>
                <h4>Winner</h4>
                <p>My three teammates and I won the 2016 Engineering Physics robot competiton. Our challenge, which varies from year to year, was to make a miniature autonomous taxi robot that could pick up stuffed dolls that were emitting an IR signal, and drop them off at some specified location. Here is a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAR5WVmitQ8" target="_blank">video</a> of our robot in action. Out robot, named Jett Pace, was built from raw materials cut on a water jet cutter. All of the electrical circuits were soldered onto PCBs and installed in our robot. I designed most of the signal processing circuits as well an also built the power transmission circuits. I also made a large contribution to the code as well. I mostly attribute our success to the fact that our team carried a variety of skills, and it was our ability to work in a team that lead us to win the competition. Please see our <a href="https://danielchawla.github.io/jett-pace-webpage/" target="_blank">web page</a> for more details.</p>

                <p>It was my first year in university that I learnt how to write code. I took an "Introduction to programming with C" course, and from the skills I learnt in that course alone, I was able to write a chess opponent in C (<a href="https://github.com/ryancotsakis/chess" target="_blank">Chess</a>). I also wrote a Suduko solver (<a href="https://github.com/ryancotsakis/sudoku" target="_blank">Sudoku</a>), a maze generator (<a href="https://github.com/ryancotsakis/corn-maze" target="_blank">Corn-Maze</a>), and few other projects, all written in C. I am very interested cryptography, and so I made an executable file in windows that would encrypt and decrypt text documents (<a href="https://github.com/ryancotsakis/cryptography" target="_blank">Cryptography</a>). It's the only software I use to store all of my passwords on.</p>

                <h3>A Random Proof</h3>
                <p>I mentioned above that I love mathematics. I am choosing to include this miscellaneous project on my page because I spent a considerable amount of time on this project. I was on YouTube, and I came across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y30VF3cSIYQ" target="_blank">video</a> that described a very tough problem in number theory. I set out to solve this problem, and it consumed a lot of my time. Here is a link to my solution:</p>

                <h4>Third Year Representative</h4>
                <p>I'm in my third year of Engineering Physics at UBC and I represent the third year class in the Engineering Physics Undergraduate Society. Eng Phys is the most intensive, and competitive engineering program offered at UBC, partly due the number of credits we have to take, but also the amount of math and physics we take is comparable to a major in just that field. In fact, because I am taking a few extra math courses, I will be graduating with a minor in honours mathematics. A large milestone in Engineering Physics is the Engineering Physics <a href="#projects">robot competition</a>, in which my team of four placed first. I am currently maintaining an average of 90% in all of my classes.</p>
