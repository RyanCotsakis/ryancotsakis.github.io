                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <h4>A Day in the Life</h4>
                <p>I live in the suburbs, North Delta, so I spend a lot of time going to and from school. I enjoy commuting on my electric bicycle, and taking the bus when the weather's no good. On my free time, I like thinking about mathematics, discussing it with my friends at school, and letting my friends at home take my mind off of it. I also enjoy skateboarding, programming, and hiking.</p>
                <h4>My Skills</h4>
                <p>I am proficient in Java, Python, C, C++, HTML, and CSS. I gained much experience with electrical circuits while working in a team of four to build an autonomous robot, and while manufacturing electric bicycles at Grin Technologies. I am well trained to work in a metal and woodshop, and I can juggle and do a standing backflip (not at the same time).</p>

                <h3>Grin Technologies</h3>
                <h4>Electrical, Software, and Shop Technician</h4>
                <p>At Grin Technologies, I had one of the best work experiences I could have asked for. Grin manufactures and sells their own electric bicycle conversion kits. Not only did I gain a sweet electric bicycle from Grin, but I learned an almost uncountable number of skills. My position at the workplace was one of a software engineer, electrical engineer, electronics manufacturer, metal shop worker, handyman, and bike technician.</p>
                <p>Before Grin, I hadn't ever written code in Python. But after only a few days I started a project that took real time serial data and updated a user interface, all independently, all in Python. Grin accompanied the software I was working on with a simple electrical device, and I had a hand in designing the circuitry for that device. The Battery Grinspector is soon to be released. I learned how solder, crimp wires, populate PCBs, and test the products we were producing. I also became very familiar with the tools in the metal shop. I was constantly fabricating parts on the milling machine, band saw, drill press, and CNC machine. I did a few renovations at work too; for instance I demolished an office to make more space for the warehouse, and I spent a week or two constructing a wooden deck that spanned over 50 feet. I also gained some very technical experience in the maintnence and assembly of bicycles. I laced and trued many wheels for many customers and indeed for my own electric bike!</p>

                <h3>Autonomous Robot Competition</h3>
                <h4>Winner</h4>
                <p>My three teamates and I won the 2016 Engineering Physics Robot Competiton. Our challenge, which varies rom year to year, was to make a miniature autonomous taxi robot that could pick up stuffed dolls that were emitting an IR signal, and drop them off at some specified location. Here is a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAR5WVmitQ8" target="_blank">video</a> of our robot in action. Out robot, named Jett Pace, was built from raw materials cut on a waterjet cutter. All of the electrical circuits were soldered onto PCBs and installed in our robot. I designed most of the signal processing circuits as well an also built the power transmission circuits. I also made a large contribution to the code as well. I mostly attribute our success to the fact that our team carried a variety of skills, and it was our ability to work in a team that lead us to win the competition. Please see our <a href="https://danielchawla.github.io/jett-pace-webpage/" target="_blank">web page</a> for more details.</p>
